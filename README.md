This script is used to create a new Linux user and send an email to the email address provided in the input file with the user ID and password. The input file is a CSV file that is passed as a command line argument to the script.

The script first reads the input CSV file using the pd.read_csv function from the Pandas library and stores the data in a variable called input. Then, it sets the email login credentials and the sender's email address using the config module.

Next, the script loops through each row of the input data and retrieves the email address, first name, last name, and YSU ID of the user. It then uses the subprocess.run function to check if the user already exists on the system. If the user does not exist, the script creates a new user using the useradd command and sets the password using the chpasswd command.

Finally, the script sends an email to the email address provided in the input file with the subject "LINUX USERID AND PASSWORD". The email body is not provided in the script, so it will only send the subject line.

This code send an email with the new Linux user ID and password. It uses the smtplib library to connect to the SMTP server (in this case, Gmail) and send the email.

The code creates a MIMEMultipart object called mimemsg, which is used to construct the email message. It sets the sender's email address, recipient's email address, and subject line using the mimemsg object.

Next, it attaches the email body to the message using the MIMEText object and sets the email body to be plain text.

The code then connects to the Gmail SMTP server using the smtplib.SMTP function and logs in using the email login credentials stored in the a_username and a_password variables.

After successfully logging in, the code sends the email message using the send_message function and closes the connection using the quit function.

Finally, the code resets the user password expiration using the passwd command. The subprocess.Popen function is used to run the command in a shell.
